# Frontend for app that generates an AI promt, and uses MCP to connect this AI app to Facebook.

### Tech Stack: NextJS, Vite (Dev/ Deployment)

<h4>The posts that this app generates are only available for show on my personal Facebook accounts. I believe this is due to the fact that the Facebook app is not live. However it will still work and generate a proper response. It is stil a fullstack app that goes from the front end, to the backend, to my Facebook page. I will try and fix this as soon as possible. Sorry.</h4>
